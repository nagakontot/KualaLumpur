The city is the centre of many things in Malaysia. It began with the discovery of tin in the 1850s at the confluence of the Gombak and Klang rivers. Hence it is the place of the discovery that gave the city its name, which means muddy (Malay: lumpur) confluence (kuala).<br><br>Kuala Lumpur is the sixth most visited city in the world, with 8.9 million tourists per year. Tourism here is driven by the city's cultural diversity, relatively low costs, and wide gastronomic and shopping variety.<br><br>Driving yourself in Kuala Lumpur is not recommended. Heavy traffic, suicidal motorcyclists and bad signposts at some time make it very difficult, espcially if you are used to driving at the righthand side of the road and just arrived in the country. There is no use of getting around by car anyway with the good public transport there is nowadays.</div></div><p class=myneon style=position:absolute;left:1%;bottom:1%;font-size:1.618vh>Quick tour of Kuala Lumpur.
